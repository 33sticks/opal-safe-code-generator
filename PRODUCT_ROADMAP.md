           REJECTED   DEPLOY_FAILED
```

**Database Schema Updates:**

```sql
-- Add approval workflow fields to generated_code table
ALTER TABLE generated_code
ADD COLUMN status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'generated', -- generated, qa_review, approved, rejected, deployed, deploy_failed
ADD COLUMN reviewer_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
ADD COLUMN reviewed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN review_notes TEXT,
ADD COLUMN approver_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
ADD COLUMN approved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN rejection_reason TEXT;

-- Add audit trail table
CREATE TABLE code_audit_log (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    generated_code_id INTEGER REFERENCES generated_code(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- created, reviewed, approved, rejected, deployed
    previous_status VARCHAR(50),
    new_status VARCHAR(50),
    notes TEXT,
    metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_code_audit_log_code_id ON code_audit_log(generated_code_id);

- [ ] Review/approval dialog with notes field
- [ ] Audit trail view showing status history
- [ ] Filters by status (e.g., "Pending Review", "Approved")
- [ ] Email notifications for status changes (optional)

**Backend Endpoints:**

```python
# Update status endpoints
PUT /api/v1/generated-code/{id}/status
{
    "status": "qa_review",
    "notes": "Ready for QA"
}

PUT /api/v1/generated-code/{id}/approve
{
    "notes": "Approved for deployment"
}

PUT /api/v1/generated-code/{id}/reject
{
    "reason": "Selector not found"
}

## 3. Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4) - Learning & Intelligence

### 3.1 Feedback Loop: Code Corrections Improve Templates

**Goal**: Create a self-improving system where user corrections automatically enhance future code generation.

**Database Schema:**

```sql
-- Track code corrections and improvements
CREATE TABLE code_corrections (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    generated_code_id INTEGER REFERENCES generated_code(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    brand_id INTEGER REFERENCES brands(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    template_id INTEGER REFERENCES templates(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    
    -- Correction details
    original_code TEXT NOT NULL,
    corrected_code TEXT NOT NULL,
    correction_type VARCHAR(50), -- selector_fix, logic_fix, style_fix, rule_compliance
    correction_reason TEXT,
    corrected_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    
    -- Context
    test_type VARCHAR(50),
    test_description TEXT,
    
    -- Processing status
    applied_to_template BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    applied_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    
    -- Timestamps
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Link corrections to specific templates for learning
CREATE TABLE template_improvements (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    template_id INTEGER REFERENCES templates(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    correction_id INTEGER REFERENCES code_corrections(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    improvement_type VARCHAR(50), -- pattern_update, selector_add, rule_add
    applied_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_code_corrections_brand_id ON code_corrections(brand_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_code_corrections_applied ON code_corrections(applied_to_template);
```

**Process Flow:**

1. **User Makes Correction**:
   - User edits generated code in UI
   - System detects changes via diff algorithm
   - User provides reason/notes
   - Correction saved to `code_corrections` table

2. **AI Analysis**:
   - System analyzes correction patterns

   - Categorizes by type (selector, logic, style, compliance)

3. **Template Enhancement**:
   - For selector fixes: Add new selectors to brand's selector list
   - For logic fixes: Update template code patterns
   - For rule compliance: Add new rules or update existing ones
   - Mark corrections as `applied_to_template = true`

4. **Continuous Learning**:
   - Future code generation uses improved templates
   - Confidence scores increase as templates improve
   - Fewer corrections needed over time

**Backend Implementation:**

```python
# Service: code_corrections.py
class CodeCorrectionService:
    async def record_correction(
        self,

        original: str,
        corrected: str,
        reason: str,
        user_id: int
    ):
        """Record a code correction for learning."""
        
    async def analyze_corrections(self, brand_id: int):
        """Analyze correction patterns and suggest template improvements."""
        
    async def apply_improvements(self, brand_id: int):
